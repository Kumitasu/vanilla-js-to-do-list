# Pure JS todo list
> As a learning process I've made a pure JS todo list. As a source of information I've used materials from Coding BootCamp and some Tutorials from youtube.



## General Information 
- You can Add/Remove your Todos to localStorage
- You can sort your list by 3 categories: All/Completed/Uncompleted
